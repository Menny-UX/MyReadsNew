# MyReads Project

This project contains mainly 2 pages :
    - Home includes My Shelves List of books ['currently Reading', 'Want to Read', 'Read']
    - Search includes a search action that can be preformed to explore books about particular topic or by a      specific auther

## Usage

* install all project dependencies with `yarn`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

Dependent on https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
